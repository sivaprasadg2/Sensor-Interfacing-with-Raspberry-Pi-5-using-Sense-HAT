# Sensor-Interfacing-with-Raspberry-Pi-5-using-Sense-HAT
 Introduction
This lab introduces students to embedded sensor interfacing using the Raspberry Pi 5
with the Sense HAT. The objective is to demonstrate reading sensor data (temperature,
humidity, and pressure) and displaying a message using the LED matrix. This provides
hands-on experience in Python-based embedded development relevant to IoT and smart
systems.
2 Methodology
The Raspberry Pi was configured in headless mode to allow SSH access. The Sense HAT
library was installed using apt. Two Python scripts were written: one for displaying
messages on the LED matrix, and one for reading and printing sensor values.
2.1 Software and Hardware Used
• Programming language: Python 3
• Libraries: sense-hat, time
• Hardware: Raspberry Pi 5, Sense HAT (attached via GPIO)
